Version 2.0 (in progress)
- New library introduced: putils
    * TS_Resource moved to putils
    * TS_Queue moved to putils
- TS_Resource:
    * lock() function added.
    * notification system introduced
    * removing get()
    * introducing operator->()
- TS_Queue:
    * Removing break_popping() from public section. stop() function introduced instead.
    * TS_Queue should now keep working after stop() is called. Any new insertion reenabled queue.
    * Introducing threadsWaiting4Data() and waitForData()
- Visual Studio build fixes.
- OpenLibrary shared libraries versioning.
- OPENLIBRARY_NAMESPACE introduced. Now all libraries will use this macro for main namespace
- cleanups in cmake files:
    * OPENLIBRARY_CMAKE_INCLUDES renamed to OPENLIBRARY_USE_FILE
    * OPENLIBRARY_INCLUDE_DIRS and OPENLIBRARY_LIBRARIES variables added.
    * OpenLibraryVersion.cmake introduced. find_package() can be used with version now.
    * removing old methods of package registration. Now each library defines itself as it wish and then just registers final target with register_target()

TODO:
- introduce debug/release versions in parallel?
- make sure libraries without target (no sources, just headers) are working fine (can be find with find_package in projects using them)
